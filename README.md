# KNN vs Naive Bayes (on heart dataset)
## Introduction
Data Mining Course Project

In this project, the aim is to implement KNN and Gaussian Naive Bayes from scratch and evaluate their accuracy-score on [heart dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).
## Installation
First, you need to clone this repository to your local machine via the following command:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Ali-Jedari/KNN_vs_NaiveBayes.git
```
In case you don't have `git` installed on your computer, you can download the zip file of this repository and then, extract it.
## Requirements
This project is written in Python3 and requires Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn libraries.

All the required libraries can be installed by running the following command:
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If the command above results in an error, you can also try:
```shell
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also, the dataset (.csv file) should be downloaded on your computer.

Dataset: [heart dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease)
## Usage
Run:
```shell
$ cd KNN_vs_NaiveBayes
$ python main.py
```
